The Sustainable Slum Redevelopment and Monitoring platform incorporates a multifaceted 
approach to tackle the multifarious challenges faced by slum residents. It enables residents to 
report issues, ranging from inadequate housing and infrastructure to sanitation problems, and 
even social concerns such as security and community development. This reporting 
mechanism facilitates efficient communication and coordination among residents, authorities, 
and other stakeholders, ensuring timely responses to pressing issues.
